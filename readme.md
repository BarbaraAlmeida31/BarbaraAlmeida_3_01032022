# Project Summary

Access the project through [this link](https://github.com/BarbaraAlmeida31/BarbaraAlmeida_3_01032022).

Ohmyfood is a new startup that wants to make a name for itself in the restaurant business. The objective is to develop a 100% mobile-friendly site that lists the menus of gourmet restaurants. 

In addition to having a classic reservation system, customers will be able to select the dishes they want for their meal so that they are ready when they arrive.

The project was developed following the [Creative Brief](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/course.oc-static.com/projects/Web%20Developer%20P3/Creative%20Brief%20-%20Ohmyfood!.pdf) and [Mockups](https://course.oc-static.com/projects/Front-End+V2/P3+CSS+animations/Projet+3+-+ohmyfood+EN.zip).

# Build Status

As the target market is the connected and hurried population, the site was developed
using the mobile-first approach. Even so, a version was developed that adapts to desktop and tablet.

## Current Website Features
### Homepage (x1)
 -  Display the location of restaurants. Eventually, it will be possible to choose
restaurants close to a certain place.

 - A short presentation of the company.

 - A section containing the four menus in the form of cards. When clicking on the card,
the user is redirected to the menu page.

### Menu Pages (x4)
-  Four pages each containing a restaurant menu.

### Footer
-  The footer is identical on all pages.

-  When you click on Contact, a link to an email address is made.

### Header
- The header is present on all pages.

- The home page contains the logo of the site.

- The menu pages contain a button to return to the home page.


# Main Requirements 
On tablet and desktop, the site will have to adapt.

## Compatibility

- The whole site will have to be responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

- The pages will have to pass W3C validation in HTML and CSS without errors.

- The site must be fully compatible with the latest desktop versions of Chrome,
Firefox, and Safari.

# Features 

## Graphic Effects and Animations
The effects accessible by clicking or hovering are visible on the model.

### Buttons
- When hovering, the background color of the main buttons lighten slightly. The
drop shadow also is more visible.

- Eventually, visitors will be able to save their favorite menus. For that, a heart-shaped
Like button is present on the model. When you click on it, it fill up gradually.


### Home Page
- As the application will have more menus, a loading spinner is necessary.
It will appear for 3 seconds when you arrive on the home page, cover the whole screen, and disappears, giving space to the home page.

### Menu Pages
- When arriving on the page, the dishes appear gradually with a slight time lag.
Appearing either one by one or by group Starter, Main course, and Dessert.

- The visitor can add the dishes he wishes to his order by clicking on them. A small
checkmark appears to the right of the dish. This tick slide from right to left.
